HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES|1821 N. 73RD ST., OMAHA, NE 68114|4025952816|BARRY DEJONG|SERVICE AREA ADMIN.|     The first area identified was in regards to a potential conflict of interest if the public employee can make a decision that may cause financial benefit to a member of their family. In My case there is not potential conflict because of the following: his salary is set by an independent governing board. It is not contingent on the number of clients served. I have no input into the rates paid for services, the ability to contract with the provider or if consumers chose that provider.               The second area of concern deals with the potential to obtain confidential information for financial gain for a family member. His role as a public official offers access to confidential information necessary to administer to the needs of the people we serve. This is the same information that our other business partners have. It is not useful in anyway other than to provide supports that people have asked for. In both my role and Mr. Brinker's role as the administrator of a human service agency there are controls in place to ensure the highest level of confidentiality. |||||||

Wilderness Heights-shown as Final Action on S. 40th and Yankee Hill Rd.  Wilderness Heights is owned by Lincoln Federal Bank. Lincoln Federal is a partial owner of an LLC, LFSH, LLC, which LLC is a joint venture partner with Capitol Title in a business called Lincoln Title. Capitol Title Company is a wholly owned subsidiary of HomeServices of Nebraska, Inc., of which I am the Chief Operating Officer, but not an owner.|Financial benefits to the Company may be realized if the developer/owner lists the property above-described with either Woods Bros. Realty or Home Real Estate or utilizes title insurance or escrow closing services of the joint venture, Lincoln Title, in conjunction with the eventual sale of such property. Any benefit to HomeServices as a result of the joint venture with Lincoln Title would not be direct, but would simply be  a portion of overala profits/loss of the JV as determined.    At present there is not an agreement for the Developer to list these properties with a HomeServices Company and there are not any Lincoln Federal lots currently with Home or Woods Bros. Because there is no current agreement, I am uncertain when or whether such properties may in the future be listed with a HomeServices Company. If listings were with an agent on the 100% commission plan the Company would not receive any direct monetary commission benefit other than a small broker's administrative commission on the first two transacions each year. 100% agents keep the total of their commission and pay a non-varying flat marketing fee to the company rather than splitting commission.    Any benefit to the Company as a result of a Buyer's use of a HOME or Woods agent, or use of Capitol Title is purely speculative and the nature of any such benefit would be dependent upon the agent who was involved in such transaction.||||1|Home Services of NE, Inc.|

As part of this process, Section 4, now codified as 79-1104.01, requires that the NE Dept. of Education (NDE) select and enter into an agreement with an endowment provider.  It is my understanding that the NE Children and Families Foundation (NCFF) of which I am a board member, anticipates submitting a proposal to NDE to be selected as the endowment provider.  Under Section 2 of Article VII of the NE Constitution and 79-301(1), the NDE is composed of the State Board of Education and the Commissioner of Education.  Therefore, both the Commissioner and the State Board of Education, of which I am a member, will be required to approve the aggreement with the endowment provider.  The State Board may also vote on the selection of the endowment provider.  These actions will most likely take place at the December 2006 Board Meeting.  It is my understanding that the NCFF will benefit financially, directly or indirectly, if it is selected and enters into an agreement with NDE to be the endowment provider.

I, Gary Hamer, in my position as Deputy Director of the Department, was going to serve on the proposal evaluation committee, and participate in the final selection of a contractor to carry out the functions of the Act. However, one of the potential bidders is a corporatin known as Invest Nebraska. I am currently serving, in an appointed position, as a director on the board of such organization.    As a result of my business association with Invest Nebraska, I will be removed from the porposal evaluation committee and will no longer participate in the final selection of a contractor. I will also refrain from participating in the development of a proposal for submission to the Department of Economic Development on behalf of Invest Nebraska. |In the event that Invest Nebraska does submit a bid in response to the RFP, and in the event that Invest Nebraska is selected through the public bidding process to be awarded the contract, Invest Nebraska would be awarded $250,000 each year, for two years (provided that Invest Nebraska could satisfy the matching requirements). There would be no personal financial benefit. I do not receive a salary ro any fees for my membership on the board. |1|||1|Invest Nebraska|

I have no doubt that this would certainly be a conflict of Interest if we were trying to sell the building or tear it douwn and re-hab it. However, this is not the case since the landlord has already remodeled the building and prefers to rent it out. I have never had a prospective tenant that inquired about blight and TIF districts or made a decision on that basis, and declaring the neighborhood blighted bould not result in any higher rents for the landlord nor higher commissions for me. Generally, however , tenants DO ask if ownership might be a possibility at some point, so we do say in our advertising that the owner would consider selling it, although we do not officially have it listed for sale at this time. I would like to see if this is a conflict of interest and if I should abstain from voting.

A new dealership at S. 33rd Street and Yankee Hill Road (Special Permit 09022 and Change of Zone 09025) and the expansion of a dealership at S. 27th Street and Tamarin Ridge Road (Special Permit 07015A). The new dealership at Yankee Hill Road is approximately one mile southeast of DuTeau and the dealership on S. 27th Street is directly across the street to the west of DuTeau.    DuTeau Chevrolet Subaru is in the process of acquiring land for the relocation of the Subaru franchise. Our original plans were to acquire the land at S. 27th Street and Tamarin Ridge Road but we were unsuccessful. This is the same parcel of land covered by Special Permit 07015A and scheduled for hearing on October 21st.    Due to my history with S. 27th and Tamarin Ridge Road and the proximity of both auto dealership applications, I would feel most comfortable declaring a conflict of interest.|Proximity of competing auto dealerships.

The DSC would involve a new methodology in City interaction with the development community and/or construction and remodeling of new space in the City-County Building and co-location of several departments or representatives from several departments.    The DSC concept was presented to the Lincoln/Lancaster County Public Building Commission with a request to have the construction started. The Public Building Commission asked the Mayor to first get approval from the Lincoln City Council, which is now being instigated with an informational meeting on June 29, 2009.    Secondary to the DSC is the possibility the City will relocate part or all of its Urban Development Department to the City-County Building to be close to the DSC. The Urban Development lease with Haymarket Square expires on February 28, 2010.    The question is whether discussion on the creation of the Development Services Center creates a conflict of interest for Jon Camp, who, through his ownership in Haymarket Square Partnership, currently leases space to the Urban Development. The Lease for Urban Development terminates on February 28, 2010, unless the City exercises its option to renew.    The issue is whether a DSC should be created.    The City of Lincoln can relocate the Urban Development Department regardless of whether the DSC is created.    Thus, can Jon Camp participate in discussions concerning the Development Services Center?     |Jon Camp is a majority partner in Haymarket Square Developers, a general partnership. Haymarket Square currently leases office space to the City of Lincoln's Urban Development Department under a lease that expires February 28, 2010. The City of Lincoln has six one-year renewal options, exercisable solely at the discretion of the City.|1||Jon Camp|1|Haymarket Square|

Pinewood Bowl is an outdoor entertainment facility that accommodates 3,000 or more patrons for activities such as musical events or plays.  Pinewood Bowl is located in Pioneers Park, a City-owned facility.    The Pioneers Park Nature Center is located in a portion of City-owned Pioneers Park and has the ability to serve functions of approximately 80 individuals. It is located near wildlife pastures with such animals at North American Bison    Auld Pavilion is a dance hall constructed in the 1920s or 1930s that accommodates functions up to approximately 20 individuals.  Auld Pavilion is City-owned and located in Antelope Park, west of Capitol Blvd. and 33rd Street, adjacent to children's playgrounds and picnic shelters.    Jon Camp has served on the Lincoln City Council for 12 years since May 1999.    Jon Camp started redeveloping properties in Lincoln's Historic Haymarket in August 1982 and continues to do so.    Jon Camp owns properties located in Lincoln's Historic Haymarket through the Haymarket Square Partnership (HMS), the CH, LTD Corporation (CH Ltd.) and the AJC Investments, LLC (AJC).  These properties include 9 buildings that are utilized for commercial, retail, and office spaces.  Within two buildings are three reception facilities: (1) the Ridnour Room, (2) North Apothecary Loft, and (3) South Apothecary Loft.    The Apothecary Lofts have master bedroom suites making them unique and different from other venues in Lincoln.  The Ridnour Room is a reception facility that can accommodate 300 guests.  All three facilities are different than other venues because no food nor beverage catering is provided by CH, Ltd.|The matter before the Lincoln City Council raises the question of whether permitting alcohol at City Park facilities will have financial impact or effect on the business of Jon Camp.    First, within the City of Lincoln, there are a wide variety and number of facilities offering reception rooms that will have minimal, if any financial impact on Jon Camp's three facilities. This includes venues like golf courses, restaurants with party rooms, pure reception facilities, and hotels and motels with reception areas.    Second, the targeted clientele of Mr. Camp's three facilities represent a different demographic due to the pricing structure and quality of the facilities.    Third, features offered by the Apothecary Lofts are different that those of the City because the Apothecary Lofts also are more similar to lodging facilities.  In fact, CH, Ltd. charges "lodging taxes" on overnight stays.    Fourth, the Apothecary Lofts and the Ridnour Room are unique because guests have complete freedom and flexibility to handle food and beverage service as they desire.  Facility hosts can even bring in their own food and beverages.    The NADC should consider whether ownership of Mr. Camp of properties in the Historic Haymarket will incur financial gains or losses due to the addition of alcohol.  Mr. Camp's properties are located in Lincoln's Historic Haymarket, which is several miles away from the Auld Pavilion and much further way from Pinewood Bowl and the Nature Center, both of which are located in Pioneers Park.    Because the Auld Pavilion and the Nature Center already market to weddings and other activities, will there be financial gain/loss to Mr. Camp beyond any financial gain/loss that currently exists.    Because Mr. Camp commenced his development in Historic Haymarket in 1982, he has provided leadership in the modern era of Haymarket and continues to do so.  However, to disqualify Mr. Camp from considering a project before the Lincoln City Council should be analyzed on an individual basis, which is the purpose of this application.    In this particular case, the existence of a very competitive market for reception facilities insulates Mr. Camp from any real conflict of interest in this present matter.|1|||1|Haymarket Square CH, Ltd|

I am a member of the school board and also a local substitute. The Elementary School secretary makes calls to fill the substitute positions for the district. I was approved as a local sub this past year and so renewed a previous certificate that I had let expire when I was running a restaurant. I have asked the secretary to only call me if they are unable to find anyone else as we have a farming and ranching operation that takes most of my time and energy.  The farm is our livlihood. When I am gone from the farm it puts a hardship on my husband and he usually hires someone to help him if I am going to be gone. The school was in need of a "long term" sub to fill in while the preschool teacher was out on maternity leave. They could not find anyone so I told them I would fill the morning(preschool) position if they could find someone else to take her afternoon duties at the high school as I could not be away from the farm all day.  They were able to find a retired teacher who was willing to take the afternoon duties  but did not want anything to do with the preschool. I did fill in for 5 1/2 weeks in October and November, mornings only, while the teacher was out on leave. We have a split board and other members of the board believe that sine I have a "financial interest' because I am "employed" by the district that I should not be able to vote when it comes time for renewing the Superintendent's contract.  My husband hired two people to help him while I was in town substituting. I feel like I was doing my community a service and was not in it "for the money" as it cost us $18 per hour to hire the help while I was gone. I believe in helping my school and my community when needed and would like to be able to make myself available when the school is in a crunch but I don't want to interfere with my duties on the board. I would like your opinion as to whether this constitutes a conflict of interest with my duties as a board member and whether I need to abstain when voting on issues dealing with the superintendent|I don't believe there is a financial benefit because of the payout for farm help but I did receive substitute pay for the time I spent filling in for the preschool teacher.  I do not see any long term benefit since I always ask them to try to find someone else and to only call me as a last resort. We have hired several more local subs in the past month and a half so there should be a larger pool for them to call before they would call me.    Two of the board members also have wives who are local subs and fill in pretty regularly. One of the wives was not called in this instance because they like to use her at the high school because she is a better fit there and I did see her several times during the time I was filing in.  Her husband and his best buddy on the board are the main ones questioning whether I should be able to vote. The other board members wife was called but she turned it down because they were harvesting corn. Several other subs I spoke with also turned it down because of the timing-most are involved with farming and ranching in some way and fall is a very busy time for us all.|1|||||

Stat. $77-2734.04 and 77-2734.14 to define terms and to change provisions relating to the apportionment of income between states for the purposes of taxation. The intent of the bill, according to Sen. Hadley, is to provide that for purposes of income taxation, the sale of intangibles and services be treated the same as current Nebraska law treats the sale of manufactured and retail tangible goods and imposes the state income tax based on a market-based source of income approach rather than the current "all or nothing" cost of performance approach. According to the Nebraska Department of Revenue, LB 872 will increase corporate income tax for corporations located outside of Nebraska that provide services or intangibles to customers located in Nebraska (LB 872 Fiscal Note, dated January 25, 2012).    At the public committee hearing for LB 872 on January 27, 2012, the Nebraska Broadcasters Association raised concerns with the bill. It is my understanding that the Association is now working on a proposed amendment that would exempt broadcast companies from the scope of this bill. |As a part owner of two radio stations in Nebraska, the passage of this bill in its original form could result in a change in both the availability and cost of the services or intangibles consumed by my businesses that come from providers outside of the State.   |1|||1|KUSO-FM and KNEN-FM|If you will not abstain from acting on a matter state why, despite the potential conflict, you intend to vote or otherwise participate.

This is for a Walmart which will have full access to 27th street at Grainger Parkway and right in/right out access at Jamie Lane. While the appeal has several issues the potential conflict concerns the request for walmart to eliminate access to Grainger Parkway and take full access from Jamie Lane.    I'm one of the owners of DuTeau Subaru at 2750 Jamie Lane. It is possible that if Jamie Lane and 27th Street changes from a right in/right out intersection to full access my business could reap some benefit. Personally I believe that DuTeau Subaru has great access with the current road network and full access will not provide any real benefit.    In order to avoid any appearance of a conflict, I request a ruling from the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission. Duteau Subaru is part of a parcel of commercially zoned land. This triangle of land is bounded by South 27th Street, Jamie Lane and Granger Parkway. Currently the only access to DuTeau Subaru is from Jamie Lane, but when the land to the north develops there will be access to Granger Parkway via an internal roadway system. |A full access intersection at South 27th and Jamie Lane could provide greater access for our customers. ||||1|DuTeau Subaru|

The proposed amendment would remove paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of Section 6-428 of ordinance 5165.  This portion of the ordinance has been enforced because the constitutionality of this portion of the ordinance has been the subject of a lawsuit aginst the city since it was passed.    Paragraph 2 of the ordiance makes it unlawful for any person or entity that owns a rental unit in the city of fremont to harbor an illegal alien in the dwelling unit...unless such harboring is otherwise expressly permitted by federal law.    Paragraph 3 requires anyone age 18 or older to obtain an "occupancy license" prior to occupying any leased or rented dwelling unit.    Paragraph 4 outlines the enforcement requirements of paragraphs 2 and 3.    A potential conflict of interest exists because removing this portion of the oridance may effect the demand for housing in fremont, nebraska.|An argument has been made that I could benefit financially if the "occupancy license" provision was removed because illegal aliens would be occupying housing in fremont, nebraska, increasing demand for housing which in turm increases rental rates and occupancy rates.

This city resolution would authorize the use of $5.728 Million in Tax Increment Financing (TIF) for the P Street Streetscape Project in Downtown Lincoln, roughly from Centennial Mall on the East to North 9th Street on the West. The question is that, since I reside in a 10th floor condominium in the University Towers, located at the 128 N. 13th St, the NE corner of 13th and P Streets, do i have a conflict of interest that would prohibit me from voting on this resolution?|This project is intended to improve traffic patterns, parking, and sidewalk access to businesses along the P Street corridor. My spouse and I are residents of the condominiums at 13th and P. We do not stand to receive any direct benefit, but could see increased property values as a result. However, that could also be said about most projects in the downtown area. |1|1|Janet Hannah Eskridge|||As stated above, I do not perceive that there is a direct financial benefit that results from this project. Indeed, improved traffic and parking is of little benefit to us as we live there and do not utilize on-street parking. It seems to me that this public project is a benefit for the entire community. If I owned a business located at street level, that may be different, but that is not the situation here.

FRANK TURK|CHAIRMAN OF BOARD|Date action is to be taken or decision is to be made: Future Action    One of the new initiatives that the Nebraska Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Board is advocating for is complete pediatric hearing aid insurance coverage for Nebraska children under the age of 18. The Board, as a secondary point, is also seeking to require all insurance companies to have hearing aid coverage as an essential health care benefit in Nebraska for adults. In addition, for those insurance companies that do provide hearing aid coverage, advocate for better coverage as a health care benefit coverage limits are too low. Due to the complexity of healthcare laws on the federal and state level such advocacy will have to be done a number of different levels. At this point, advocacy will include asking the state personal department to increase its health insurance benefits for state employees and submit formal comments to the Federal HHS that the Nebraska Essential Health Benefits should include complete pediatric hearing aid coverage and require all insurance plans in the state to provide hearing aid coverage. The Board in giving guidance and direction in its September 11, 2015 meeting will expect a more detailed report on how to achieve this specific goal in its Board meeting on December 11, 2015 and is expected to take a more formal vote on the additional steps based on additional research and due diligence. It is possible in our research that we will also be advocating that such coverage for all Nebraskans should be classified as preventative or habilitative in nature which would make it 100% covered.    Hearing Loss Association of American estimates 20% of the population have some form of hearing loss. With that in mind it is estimated that 20% of Nebraska State Employees have some form of hearing loss but we believe an estimated 5% may actually use hearing aids.|I wear a hearing aid and receive my health care benefit coverage from the state. It is possible that I will be purchasing a new hearing aid in the next two to three years. If the state insurance coverage increases the amount paid for a hearing aid it will reduce the amount of money I would have to pay out of pocket for the new hearing aid. Current policy limits cover up to $1,500 for every three years.|1|||||

These elections are on the ballots of the Primary/General Elections.    I was elected to serve on the Plattsmouth Rural Fire Board at the September 2, 2015 Annual Fire Board Meeting. This election is done by secret ballot by the registered voters present during the Annual Meeting.     When a member of the Fire Board discovered that I was running for the board I received the following notice from him that he indicated came from their attorney. I requested the written letter from the attorney, but have not received a copy.     "Being a member of the Cass County Board of Commissioners presents a conflict when it comes to voting on anything before the County Board that involves the rural fire district if that commissioner is an elected member of that District. The county commissioner would be placed in a position to abstain from voting on any action before the county board that involves the rural fire district. Example:  If the Budget of the Rural Fire District is before the County Board for approval, a conflict exists. If the County Commissioner that is a member of the Rural Fire District voted for or against the budget of the District, such action by that county commissioner could place both the county board and the rural fire district in a situation to render that action null and void. It could also cause an issue where the county commissioner would be unable to contribute to a discussion or vote involving the rural fire district if it comes to any action that was discussed by the Rural District Board in Closed Session."    There is no way I or my family benefit financially from being on the fire board or create a detriment to the public official or public employee. I had previously checked with the Cass County Attorney and he agrees, but suggest that I check with this office.    I am not paid any money for being on the fire board. I do receive a salary from the County for being on the County board, and the County Board votes on what this salary is to be, as well as the salaries of all County Employees.    The County does approve all of the County Fire Board Budgets as part of the County Budget, again I do not benefit monetarily from this vote.     I also serve on the SID#7 Board and the only time that something came to the County Board was the item to allow the SID to purchase some lots for back taxes with the understanding they had to be sold within 3-years. I did abstain from this vote. The lots were sold within one year and there was no financial benefit to me or my family.    Please let me know if I do have a conflict and if there is any voting on the Fire Board or the County Board that I need to abstain from.    I did not fill out Item 4, as I do not believe that there is a conflict of interest.    Sincerely,     Janet M. McCartney     |||||||

Since we last spole, the application for the "Upstream Project" was reviewed and forwarded to my Count Board of Supervisors for their review and approval or denial of the conditional use permit for the "Upstream Project". You may recall, Invenergy, L.L.C. is the primary investment group submitting the application for the conditional use permit for the "Upstream Project". It is currently scheduled for a public hearing before the Antelope County Board of Supervisors this upcoming Tuesday, May 24, 2016.    Supervisor Leroy Kerkman is a participating landowner in one of the "previous" wind energy projects by Invenergy, L.L.C. the "Prairie Breeze Project". As a "participating landowner", Sup. Kerkman entered into an easement contract with Invenergy, L.L.C. granting Invenergy, L.L.C. access to his property to install, erect, operate and maintain wind energy generating components in exchange for an easement payment. This easement contract was executed between Sup. Kerkman and Invenergy, L.L.C. for the purposes of the "Prairie Breeze Project" and conditional use permit, which was an entirely different application than the now pending "Upstream Project" application. At the time other zoning application for the "Prairie Breeze Project" was before the Antelope County Board of Supervisors, I advised Sup. Kerkman that because of the potential appearance of impropriety and conflict of interest due to the financial benefits he received as a result of his easement contract with Invenergy, L.L.C. he should recuse himself from taking any official action a supervisor up the "prairie Breeze Project" zoning application for the conditional use permit. In my opinion at the time, there was clearly a "direct" conflict of interest for him by participating and taking official action or vote on that application.    Now, the issue has been raised by opponents of the pending "Upstream Project" zoning application by invenergy, L.L.C. that, Sup. Kerkman's previous conflict continues from the "Prairie Breeze Project" since the primary investment group is once again Invenergy, L.L.C. I do not necessarily agree tigh their view of the circumstances. Sup. Kerkman's financial benefit/gain from Invenergy, L.L.C. was from an entirely different application and project. To my knowledge ther is no continuing payment(s) being paid to Sup. Kerkman by Invenergy, L.L.C. and no new easement contract between the two directly relation to the pending "Upstream Project" application before the board at this time. I am of the opinion that although there may be a slight risk of having an appearance(s) of impropriety when or if Sup. Kerkman participates in the board's official review and actions regarding future or pending applications by Invenergy, L.L.C., but there is no longer a "direct" conflict requiring him to recuse himself, unless there is a new financial or other benefit received by Sup. Kerkman as a result of that application. I am also speaking under the assumption that Sup. Kerkman has followed all statutory requirements under Neb. Rev. Stat. 49-1493(10) and made disclosure of financial interests while in office as an elected official.    |With that said, I am respectfully asking you for your assistance and your advice or opinion whether I should advise Sup. Kerkman to recuse himself from any official board action and voting on this particular "Upstream Project" application by Invenergy, L.L.C. If at all, to simply minimize any potential appearances of impropriety by Sup. Kerkman and the Board of Supervisors and/or grounds for legal action against the board and Antelope County. I would be greatly appreciative of any suggestions or advise you may provide me addressing this issue. especially, any authoritative statues and/or case law that can provide me with some legal direction as well. I must apologize in advance, I am not overly tech savvy and am currently out of my office attending the annual County Attorney's Spring Conference in Kearney. However, my secretary knows how to reach me and can forward any questions to me that you might have.  Thank for your time and assistance.||||||

In 2009, the County Board passed Resolution 2009-55, a resolution which established the salaries for the county's elected officials beginning on January 1, 2011. Resolution 2009-55 provided that each elected official would receive an annual cost of living increase on January 1, 2012, January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2014, based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), not to exceed 3% per year. The annual salaries for Washington County deputies are tied to the salaries for the County's elected officials, and as such, were to be increased consistent with the County's elected officials' salaries.     Recently it was brought to the County Board's attention that between 2011 and 2012, the salaries of elected officials were only increased by a nominal amount, although the CPI had risen by more than 3%. The following year, elected officials' salaries were increased by only 1.6% even though the CPI had increased by 2%. In 2014, the salaries were not increased, although the CPI had again risen by a0pproximately 1.4%. The county's deputies' salaries were increased consistent with the elected officials' salaries. The salaries of the Washington County Board of Commissioners were not increased at all during this time.    The County Board is committed to balancing the needs of its elected officials with the needs of its residents, including provision of competitive wages to elected officials which are consistent with the elected officials' salaries. The salaries of the Washington County Board of Commissioners were not increased at all during this time.    The County Board is committed to balancing the needs of its elected officials with the needs of its residents, including provision of competitive wages to elected officials which are consistent with the increase in the cost of living without unfairly burdening taxpayers. In order to further this goal, we will be working diligently to address this situation and to ensure the elected officials, deputies, and commissioners who provided services to the county during this time period receive the compensation prescribed by Resolution 2009-55. We ask that those interested in this issue engage ina respectful discussion of this matter so that long-term and meaningful decisions can be made that are in the best interest of Washington County.|OFFICE             DELTA(2012)    DELTA(2013)     DELTA(2014)  COUNTY SUPERVISOR     $568.05      $958.11          $1236.61|1|||||

In 2009, the County Board passed Resolution 2009-55, a resolution which established the salaries for the county's elected officials beginning on January 1, 2011. Resolution 2009-55 provided that each elected official would receive an annual cost of living increase on January 1, 2012, January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2014, based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), not to exceed 3% per year. The annual salaries for Washington County deputies are tied to the salaries for the County's elected officials, and as such, were to be increased consistent with the County's elected officials' salaries.     Recently it was brought to the County Board's attention that between 2011 and 2012, the salaries of elected officials were only increased by a nominal amount, although the CPI had risen by more than 3%. The following year, elected officials' salaries were increased by only 1.6% even though the CPI had increased by 2%. In 2014, the salaries were not increased, although the CPI had again risen by a0pproximately 1.4%. The county's deputies' salaries were increased consistent with the elected officials' salaries. The salaries of the Washington County Board of Commissioners were not increased at all during this time.    The County Board is committed to balancing the needs of its elected officials with the needs of its residents, including provision of competitive wages to elected officials which are consistent with the elected officials' salaries. The salaries of the Washington County Board of Commissioners were not increased at all during this time.    The County Board is committed to balancing the needs of its elected officials with the needs of its residents, including provision of competitive wages to elected officials which are consistent with the increase in the cost of living without unfairly burdening taxpayers. In order to further this goal, we will be working diligently to address this situation and to ensure the elected officials, deputies, and commissioners who provided services to the county during this time period receive the compensation prescribed by Resolution 2009-55. We ask that those interested in this issue engage ina respectful discussion of this matter so that long-term and meaningful decisions can be made that are in the best interest of Washington County.|office Delta (2013)  Delta(2014)  County Supervisor $958.11   $1236.61|1|||||

In 2009, the County Board passed Resolution 2009-55, a resolution which established the salaries for the county's elected officials beginning on January 1, 2011. Resolution 2009-55 provided that each elected official would receive an annual cost of living increase on January 1, 2012, January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2014, based on the U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), not to exceed 3% per year. The annual salaries for Washington County deputies are tied to the salaries for the County's elected officials, and as such, were to be increased consistent with the County's elected officials' salaries.     Recently it was brought to the County Board's attention that between 2011 and 2012, the salaries of elected officials were only increased by a nominal amount, although the CPI had risen by more than 3%. The following year, elected officials' salaries were increased by only 1.6% even though the CPI had increased by 2%. In 2014, the salaries were not increased, although the CPI had again risen by a0pproximately 1.4%. The county's deputies' salaries were increased consistent with the elected officials' salaries.

As Tax Commissioner I take official action regarding the approval or denial of Nebraska Tax Incentive applications under the Nebraska Advantage Act, Nebraska Advantage Research and Development Act, Nebraska Customized Job Training Advantage, and the Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act. The approval or denial of any potential NioCorp Nebraska Tax incentive application may result in a financial benefit or detriment to myself, my spouse, my children residing in my household, and Niocorp, a business with which I am associated. Further, if a Tax Incentives agreement between the State of Nebraska and NioCorp is entered into, my spouse and I would have interests in that agreement as a result of our respective associations with NioCorp.|NioCorp expects, as indicated in its PEA, that the Nebraska investment credits and compensation credits could offset part of the corporate federal tax rate of NioCorp over the initial part of the project. Further, NioCorp also expects, as indicated in its PEA, an offset of property taxes. See excerpt from PEA that follows:     22.3 Taxes, Royalties and Other Interests  The State of Nebraska has a number of tax incentive programs that are available to businesses of all sizes and industries. These incentives provide reductions or elimination of property, payroll, income and/or sales tax liabilities.  The State of Nebraska Tax Incentives Programs can be grouped into the following categories related to the undeveloped niobium mining/extraction activities in Elk Creek, Nebraska and Johnson County:  - Nebraska Advantage Act;  - Nebraska Advantage Research and Development Act;  - Nebraska Customized Job Training Advantage; and  - Nebraska Advantage Rural Development Act.  Based on review of the various incentive programs, it is expected that the investment credit and the compensation credits could offset part of the corporate federal tax rate over the initial part of the Project. Most likely an offset of the property taxes will occur based on the Project being a contributor to the local economy in terms of job creation.  The tax rates assumed for the economic analysis has been set at an effective rate of 20% for the first 10 years of the Project followed by a 25% effective tax rate for the remaining LoM.

I also disclosed that if a Council vote related to SENDD would come to a tie and require my vote, I would abstain rather than serve as the tie breaking vote.|Southeast Nebraska Development District is a multi-county economic development organization authorized by the US Department of Commerce - Economic Development Administration (EDA) that consists of 15 Nebraska counties and many of the areas 139 municipalities.  Its association of counties and municipalities was formed under the Interlocal Cooperation Act.  Richardson County and City of Humboldt are members of SENDD.    In 2014, prior to Crystal Dunekacke's employment, the City of Humboldt received funds from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development (DED) for two housing projects.  Once Crystal had become a certified Community Development Block Grant administrator through (DED), she began to handle the administration of those grants and disclosed her employment to the City of Humboldt. As the appointed CDBG administrator, she is responsible for assisting the City in meeting all CDBG requirements.  She nor her family are eligible to participate in the housing program so she nor her immediate family are direct beneficiaries of the program. The only consideration Crystal receives is her salary and benefits as a SENDD employee.|1|||||

I am a commercial real estate broker in North Platte and have been since 1978. We sell only CRE (Commercial Real Estate) and manage mainly CRE and government multi-family housing.    I will be representing the Hoppe family from Lincoln, Nebraska, in the sale of approximately 10 acres of ground in North Platte to a group of investors that plan to build, if TIF is available, a multi-family apartment, duplex complex. I will be receiving a fee from the seller in this leg of the transaction.     I am also assisting the builder in organizing an investment group that will own the facility after the construction is completed. We will plan to assist in organizing and supervising the project from rezoning, subdividing, to project completion. We will be receiving a fee on the investor equity investment only on this part of the transaction.    After completion, our firm, Commercial Investment Services, will lease and manage the multi-family project and be compensated by a normal management fee.    I am also on the holding company board of NebraskaLand Financial Services, which owns NebraskaLand National Bank headquartered in North Platte. The loan that will finance the project could very well be provided by NebraskaLand National Bank. I am less than 10% owner of NebraskaLand Financial Services and will not be involved with creating or negotiating the financial piece, or be signing as a borrower.     The NPCRA was created by the North Platte City Council in 2009 under the community development law section 18-2102.01. Although the CRA reviews potential projects and recommends qualified projects for approval by the North Platte City Council, the CRA does not have authority to approve the project.    That authority lies totally with the North Platte City Council after they have received a recommendation from the Planning and Zoning Commission, and then hold a public hearing. The council also is required to pre-notify all of the local taxing authorities of the date and time of the public meeting to be held to discuss the potential TIF project. The planning and zoning component requires that all residents within 350' of the project be notified by certified mail, and be published in public forums as least 14 days prior to a meeting. All meetings are open to the public for comment and the news media are also represented.    I am seeking guidance as to the extent to which my potential conflict of interest should be disclosed and to whom. I am also seeking guidance as to the level of participation I can have at both the NPCRA level and presenting the project in discussion at the Planning and Ci8ty Council level. Also, what is allowed as my participation in the discussion at the NPCRA level? I would plan to abstain at any voting level of the NPCRA.       |||||||

Costco has applied for a change of zone, a comprehensive plan amendment and a use permit for approximately 16 acres between 14th and Hazel Scott Drive along Pine Lake Road that is in my district. I have attended two neighborhood meetings and presentations by Costco. My constituents have expressed valid concerns with the safety of the children in the neighborhoods that attend Scott Middle School directly across the street to the East, Adams Elementary School two blocks to the South and Southwest High School on the West side of 14th Street. The traffic impact of a Costco will be significant. The new Costco would be approximately 1/2 a mile from our existing Super Saver grocery store on 27th Street. I am on the B & R Stores, Inc. Board of Directors as the vice chair and secretary as well as the director of buildings and equipment for the company. The new Costco would be another competitor in our trade area. |There is the possibility of a decrease in our Super Saver sales with the close proximity of the Costco or it might actually increase the sales to that store since we are a different grocery retailer with full service departments. Costco's trade area is huge and can draw customers from may municipalities to the north and south of Lincoln such as Beatrice and Seward. Costco has an excellent and well deserved reputation of being a great employer and the City of Lincoln would benefit from the Sales tax and wage increases. Costco does offer higher starting wages that will have an impact on all retailers in this area as we compete for labor.|1||JANE RAYBOULD, VICE CHAIR & SECRETARY OF B&R STORES, INC BOARD OF DIRECTORS|1|B&R STORES, INC WITH SUPER SAVERS, RUSS'S MARKET, SAVE BEST AND APPLE MARKET|

Blue Stem Energy is expected to submit a Conditional Use Permit to Cherry County Planning and Zoning soon. The Commissioners will need to vote to approve or deny their recommendation.    I did purchase 70 acres from Lyn Messersmith in 2015. This was to own the land I was building the new home on.

As you may recall from your earlier letter, Stanton County has been updating their  comprehensive plan and zoning regulations, the planning commission has now recommended changes to the comprehensive plan and zoning regulations. Newly proposed wind tower regulations look to be more restrictive than our current zoning regulations on wind towers. The County Commissioners, pursuant to law now have to act to either approve, reject or modify the recommendations for the update on the comprehensive plan and the zoning regulations. Included within the zoning regulations are recommendations to increase the wind tower distances from structures from 1,000 feet to 2,700 feet. In addition I believe there are additional restrictions on noise level. There may be other things which will no doubt come out in the public hearing. As you will recall, my wife's property in Wayne County has been entered into a wind tower lease with Way Wind,LLC. The company required that husband (myself) and wife both sign the lease.    It had been alleged that the company in Wayne County is either owned by or part of the company who had secured some wind tower leases in Stanton County. The leases in Stanton County are with Trade Wind Energy. I have no knowledge of company alignments.    Thus, to my knowledge, the only thing that has changed from the facts and your response on your earlier opinion is that the Stanton County Commissioners are in fact in the near future planning to vote to either approve, deny or modify the recommendations of the Stanton County Planning Commission. No one has at this point applied for a special use permit under our old zoning laws to actually construct a wind tower.     Please advise with a new opinion or recommendation.   |||||||

Mrs. Duncan receives no compensation for her services as an independent advisor/consultant. Mrs. Duncan last performed any services as an unpaid independent advisor/consultant to that nonprofit corporation board of directors prior to being elected to the Board of Education for the Lincoln Public Schools in about May 2015. Between about January and about June 2015, Mrs. Duncan was employed by the nonprofit corporation to make fundraising calls on behalf of the nonprofit corporation. Mrs. Duncan was paid about $900 per month as an employee of the nonprofit corporation. Mrs. Duncan is no longer employed by the nonprofit corporation and has not made any fundraising calls on behalf of the nonprofit corporation since about June 2015.    Lincoln Public Schools (LPS), is a class IV school district under the laws and statues of the State of Nebraska and is considering entering into a contract creating a Joint Public Agency (JPA) with the City of Lincoln, Nebraska (City) under Sections 13-2501 to 13-2550 known and cited as the Joint Public Agency Act. Under Section 13-2519, the JPS will constitute a separate new political subdivision and a public body corporate and politic of this state exercising public powers separate from the participating public agencies. The purpose of the JPA is to benefit both LPS and the City, and to provide a formal organization structure along with a funding source for enhanced security measures at LPS schools and additional funding for Community Learning Centers  in Lincoln (CLC's). Funding for the JPA will come from a $.01 local property tax allocated to the JPA from the City. The JPS will also form a separate nonprofit corporation to provide advice to the JPA (the "nonprofit"). The CLC's will have a business association type relationship with the nonprofit corporation.    The intent is to provide the security measures using City employees paid by the City, with reimbursement of costs and expenses to come from the JPS and LPS.    The CLC's are before and after school and summer session programs currently operated in 26 LPS school facilities. Each CLC program is operated by a "lead Agency" or service provider. While there are several CLC service providers, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Lincoln/Lancaster County (B&GC) is one of the local nonprofit lead agency partners or service providers that operates one or more of the CLC programs. In the proposed JPA, the B&GC will simply have a business association or relationship with LPS and JPA nonprofit corporation.    Mrs. Duncan asks to review her role in the NADC Form C-2A with the B&GC in light of the described business association of the B&GC with the nonprofit corporation who will provide advice to the JPA and her role as member of the LPS Board of Education, and determine whether it would be permissible for her to vote on whether LPS should approve the contract and create the described JPA with the City. |None, for Connie Duncan  None, for Boys and Girls Clubs of Lincoln/Lancaster County|1|||1|BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF LINCOLN/LANCASTER COUNTY|

I am in involved in both, but neither a substantial or even a political conflict exists by being involved in both.    On July 10, 2018, the Douglas County Board of Commissioners discussed and voted on four separate documents. These were the following:(1) an Owner's Representative Agreement among the Public Building Commission (PBC",) Douglas County & the JCDC, (2) and Ancillary Services Agreement among the PBC, Douglas County and the Agreement between Douglas County & the PBC. These were relating to the consolidated and cooperative effort to create a collaboration and trauma-informed juvenile justice courthouse and youth center('Project".) Each of these documents was intended to forward the cause of creating the new justice center and youth center, which would be of great benefit to Douglas County, its citizens and especially the youth!  |No personal financial benefit exists with regard to my position on the JCDC and my vote as a County Board member for approval of the agreements with the JCDC.

None of the Board of Directors receive compensation for their time or efforts on the JCDC Board. In addition, money provided to the JCDC by Douglas County will be used exclusively for the Project and will benefit Douglas County.    At the July 10th Board meeting, Joel Pedersen counsel for the JCDC, disclosed during discussion that I was a member of the JCDC Board. Mr. Pedersen also disclosed that a a JCDC Board member, I would not receive any compensation.    I have no financial interest in the July 10th four documents because I have not and will never receive a direct pecuniary fee or commission as a result of the County Board's approval of those documents. I have received no compensation, and will never receive compensation for my time or efforts as a Board Member of the JCDC. There is no personal financial benefit with the JCDC. The JCDC exists only to benefit Douglas County, and I will receive no personal financial benefit from either sitting on the JCDC Board of Directors or approving agreements with the JCDC as a County Board member.||||1|DOUGLAS COUNTY UNIFIED JUSTICE CENTER DEVELOPMENT CENTER|

Gene Lilly Surety Bonds is one of several providers of bid bonds, performance bonds and payment bonds to the contracting community (as well as other bond types for other industries). As a receptionist, Kara's duties will include answering phones, receiving guests, filing, writing letters and other administrative support tasks. Kara discovered the open position through indeed.com and applied for the job through the indeed system. She, along with several other candidates, was selected for a phone interview. She was then selected, along with other candidates, for an in-person interview. She was asked to return for a second in-person interview, and subsequently received the job offer. Kara will be an hourly employee with no ownership stake in the company.    Contractors bidding on NDOT projects are typically required, through State Statute and Rules & Regulations, to obtain bid and/or contract bonds from bonding agencies/sureties (of which Gene Lilly Surety Bonds is one of numerous agencies that perform this service). As a part of my contract letting process responsibilities, I make policy decisions regarding bonding requirements, and decisions regarding the acceptability of submitted bonds. In the case of a contractor's inability to secure a performance and payment bond, I am involved in the process of making a claim on a bid bond. In addition, although not a voting member, I provide contract award or rejection recommendations to the NDOT Awards Committee, the decision of which impacts the bonding agency selected by the prime contractor for their performance and payment bond. I also make contact with bonding agencies on matters that would affect their business. Gene Lilly Surety bonds is one of those companies that would typically be contacted for their input.     Given what I've presented above, I am requesting the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission advise as to whether Kara's employment with Gene Lilly Surety Bonds presents a conflict of interest with my Duties as NDOT's Highway Contracts Letting Manager.    |||||||

Although I am involved in both organizations, neither a substantial nor even a potential conflict exists between the two.     On July 10, 2018, the Douglas County Board of Commissioners discussed and voted on four separate documents relating to the effort to create a collaborative and trauma-informed juvenile justice courthouse and youth center. Each of these documents-(1) an owner's representative agreement between the Public Building Commission (PBC), Douglas County, and the JCDC, (2) an ancillary services agreement between the PBC and JCDC, (3) a memorandum of understanding between the PBC and Douglas County, and (4) a reimbursement agreement between Douglas County and the PBC- was intended to forward the cause of creating a new juvenile courthouse and youth center ("the Project"). Although I voted to approve the four agreements, including the Owner's Representative Agreement, I received no compensation, and will never receive compensation for my time or efforts as a Board Member of the JCDC.     My direct involvement with the JCDC was disclosed prior to the vote through the Omaha World Herald. I have no interest in the four documents I voted on involving the JCDC because I have not and will never receive a direct fee or commission as a result of the County Board's approval of those documents.|No personal financial benefit or detriment exists with regard to my position on JCDC and my vote for approval of the agreement with the JCDC as a County Board Member.

None of the Board of Directors receive compensation for  their time or efforts on the JCDC Board. None of the money will be a financial benefit or detriment to the JCDC itself, as the money provided to the JCDC will be used exclusively for the purposes of planning, designing, construction, and developing the Douglas County Youth Center and Justice Center Tower. The sole purpose of the JCDC is the furtherance of the Project and ultimately to benefit Douglas County, its citizens, and especially the children.||||1|DOUGLAS COUNTY UNIFIED JUSTICE CENTER DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION (JCDC)|

School districts do provide technology for students to use at school, but do not allow that technology to be taken home. The majority of the request come from teachers of the Visually Impaired/School District. Occasionally there will be a request from a NCBVI Technology Specialist in Western Nebraska as there are few Teachers of the Visually Impaired in that area. These requests are usually for Elementary, Middle School and once a while a student starting High School. Requests come in by mail or to the NFVIC website. Once the Foundation receives the request, the vice-chair shares the request and the cost with the board. The Vice Chair visits with referring party, families, etc. The foundation board will vote on the equipment. As chair I conduct the meetings, but am not a voting member.

That enterprise being the Nebraska State Capitol Foundation which today exists primarily on paper however, Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for this organization were filed with the Nebraska Secretary of State's Corporate division earlier in that year. As well, shortly after the creation of this Foundation, the Board of directors authorized me to set-up a non-interest bearing checking account for this new body with what was then First National Bank now US Bank in Lincoln.    Despite the creation of this Foundation and other good intensions the only part of this enterprise which exists today in a somewhat active way, is the  non-interest bearing bank account. Further, since IRS 501-c3 status for this Foundation was never realized and this bank account is non-interest bearing, the account has primarily functioned as a holding mechanism for a small cumulative balance over the last 33 years of $7,113.59 as of June 17, 2019.    Since the quarterly bank statements for this account are mailed to me at the Office of the Capitol Commission location on 7th Floor of the capitol and my staff is aware of the existence of this small account on behalf of the Capitol, I felt you should know. I also want to acknowledge the receipts in this account have accumulated over the years principally via honoraria I have received while making presentations to civic groups using my personal time. If honoraria was received for presentations made during my State work schedule, these amounts were deposited in our agency Cash Fund, generally known as the Capitol Restoration Fund. Further, if the donor of the honoria had an expectation of "tax deductability" I also deposited their honoraria to our agency Cash Fund.    I will keep a copy of this letter with our agency "controller" to help insure accountablilty for my actions, should they be called into question about this small Foundation account.  |||||||
